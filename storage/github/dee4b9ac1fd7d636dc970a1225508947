I actually believe that we need to re-think how versions is managed in the ui. \\r\\n\\r\\nThink of an image editor or a text editor. The context is somewhat different compared to when your'e working with Arlima but there are some similarities also. You're working with one or more objects (lists\/documents\/images) simultaneously, you have all these object visible on your screen.  You can move stuff between these objects, the objects gets altered and you can decide to save them in their current state or revert your alterations. Looking at your common text\/image editor: where have they put controls for managing versions of the objects in view? They're probably lacking the feature entirely, if not they probably haven't given it too much focus.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy point is that we have given the \\\"versions\\\" too much focus in the ui. I believe that managing of versions is something that is seldom done by the authors. Another downside with the current ux-strategy (or what to call it) is that the editor has to understand that the lists has more than two states. In your common text\/image editor you only have two states, the image\/document is either saved or unsaved. In arlima we have three different states and the author could actually be fooled into thinking that old versions can be edited and re-saved (which would be a fourth state), this is not supported but the author won't be aware of this until he\/she saves the list and realize that a new published version have been created.\\r\\n\\r\\nSorry for the OT but I really think that we need to improve the managing of versions in the UI, the controls should not be present on the list object and the third state should be removed. We can discuss this later on....\\r\\n\\r\\nOn topic:\\r\\nLet's go with suggestion nr 1 but only when needed. When the drop-down get displayed we look at the offsets of the element to determine if the drop-dow should be displayed upwards or downwards.\\r\\n  \"},{\"url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/victorjonsson\/Arlima\/issues\/comments\/69540171\",\"html_url\":\"https:\/\/github.com\/victorjonsson\/Arlima\/issues\/80#issuecomment-69540171\",\"issue_url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/victorjonsson\/Arlima\/issues\/80\",\"id\":69540171,\"user\":{\"login\":\"aaslun\",\"id\":555273,\"avatar_url\":\"https:\/\/avatars.githubusercontent.com\/u\/555273?v=3\",\"gravatar_id\":\"\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aaslun\",\"html_url\":\"https:\/\/github.com\/aaslun\",\"followers_url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aaslun\/followers\",\"following_url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aaslun\/following{\/other_user}\",\"gists_url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aaslun\/gists{\/gist_id}\",\"starred_url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aaslun\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}\",\"subscriptions_url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aaslun\/subscriptions\",\"organizations_url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aaslun\/orgs\",\"repos_url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aaslun\/repos\",\"events_url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aaslun\/events{\/privacy}\",\"received_events_url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aaslun\/received_events\",\"type\":\"User\",\"site_admin\":false},\"created_at\":\"2015-01-12T08:31:36Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2015-01-12T08:31:36Z\",\"body\":\"Good suggestion! +1.\\r\\n\\r\\nI see your point.
